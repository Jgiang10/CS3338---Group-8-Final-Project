# CS3338---Group-8-Final-Project
*This is a mock senior design project meant to mimic creating a full-scale application. The project is based on the Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement, which had the goal to improve upon the already built Parks Treasure-Hunt mobile game; the original project can be viewed here: https://ascent.cysun.org/project/project/view/98.*

## Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement
The **Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement** is designed to enhance the park experience for visitors by introducing a **gamified** exploration of the park and its amenities. The app leverages technology such as **geolocation**, **exercise tracking**, and **interactive quizzes** to create a fun and educational experience. Users can explore points of interest, interact with a virtual pet, and earn rewards by engaging in various activities such as quizzes, physical exercises, and scavenger hunts.

### **Key Features**:

* **Geolocation**: Navigate the park using your device’s GPS to find points of interest.
* **Virtual Pet**: Select a pet to care for, and monitor its health status via a health bar.
* **Pedometer**: Track your steps and earn rewards by walking in the park.
* **Exercise Detection**: Participate in physical activities like squats and earn collectible items.
* **Text-to-Speech**: Listen to park facts and information about points of interest via audio.
* **Interactive Quizzes**: Test your knowledge of the park’s natural features and win prizes.
* **Backpack**: Collect items that replenish the pet’s health and unlock new experiences.
