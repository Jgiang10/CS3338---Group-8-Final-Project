\section*{\textbf{1. Introduction}}

\subsection*{\textbf{1.1 Purpose}}
The purpose of this document is to assert the requirements for the Los Angeles County Parks \& Recreation Application. This application will allow the user to better navigate and explore the park. It will provide information about the different amenities of the park by creating interactivity with the user. The application would be a cross-platform. \\
This document is version 1.0.

\subsection*{\textbf{1.2 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions}}
Intended readers of the document consist of developers, project managers, and testers. The SRS includes product scope, external interface requirements, system features, non-functional requirements. The best way to read them is sequentially from top to bottom.

\subsection*{\textbf{1.3 System Overview}}
The application will provide information about the different points of interest of the park by displaying a carousel of images at the bottom of the home (main) screen. Each of these images correspond to one point of interest displayed on the map (main screen). The images can be selected and it will trigger a window and a virtual pet. The window has a text-to-speech functionality that will be activated automatically when the window is displayed. The question marks represent a point of interest in the park and they have functionality that can be triggered by tapping them. For the question marks to be activated the user needs to be close to them (around ten feet). If the user is close enough they can activate the question marks. When activated they can either call the Camo, Exercise or Quiz Screens. If the user is not close enough, an alert message will be displayed telling the user that it needs to be closer. \\

There is a floating button on the main screen that displays a pedometer and a backpack icon, when selected. The pedometer icon will display the number of steps taken by the user. The backpack icon will navigate to the backpack screen when tapped. The backpack screen contains the number of items collected and it allows the user to use it to replenish the health bar when its content is low. The items in the backpack can be obtained by completing squats when the exercise screen gets triggered, answering questions correctly on the quizzes and finally by locating the camouflage animal in the camo screen. \\

On the top left corner there is a pet icon. The user can select a pet by tapping the icon which will navigate to a Pet selection screen. This screen will display the available pets. \\

Last, the health bar is displayed at the top of the main screen. This bar reflects the health of the pet. The bar should not go to a minimum amount of items (one heart and one water). If it does, the user will be alerted and prompted to use the items of the backpack to replenish the health bar.

\newpage

\section{2.1 Design Considerations}

\subsection{2.1 Assumptions and Dependencies}
The application can be run on both 
 and Android devices. For iOS, it is recommended to run from version 10 and above. For Android, 4.1 and above. It must be able to access the user location. Several factors that could affect the functionality stated in the SRS include:
\begin{itemize}[label=--]
    \item Exercise detection functionality may not be totally accurate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{2.2 General Constraints}
The application must be a cross-platform application as per the request of the LA County Parks and Recreation Software Development Division. React Native Framework, Expo, and JavaScript language must be used for development.

\subsection{2.3 Goals and Guidelines}
The software has a mandatory delivery date that must be met by the end of Spring 2020 semester.

\subsection{2.4 Development Methods}
Agile Methodology.

\section{3. Architectural Strategies}

\subsection{3.1 React Native}
The application is an add-on to a previous project. Therefore, this project will be developed using the React Native framework and JavaScript programming language.
