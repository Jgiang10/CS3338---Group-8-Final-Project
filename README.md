# CS3338---Group-8-Final-Project
*This is a mock senior design project meant to mimic creating a full-scale application. The project is based on the Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement, which had the goal to improve upon the already built Parks Treasure-Hunt mobile game; the original project can be viewed here: https://ascent.cysun.org/project/project/view/98.*

# Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement
## Goals 
The main goal of the Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement is to increase awareness about the parks and their treasures, as well as to bring in more children and families to the LA County Parks. The goal was completed by incorporating a Parks Treasure-Hunt game into the mobile app, allowing users to interact and learn new treasures that are around the Parks via physically walking around the parks with their mobile devices. This idea was heavily inspired by **Pokémon Go!**, another mobile app game.
