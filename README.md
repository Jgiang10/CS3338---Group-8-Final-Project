# CS3338---Group-8-Final-Project
This is a mock senior design project meant to mimic creating a full scale application. The project is based on the Parks and Recreation Mobile App Enhancement, which had the goal to improve upon the already built Parks Treasure-Hunt mobile game; the original project can be viewed here: https://ascent.cysun.org/project/project/view/98.
